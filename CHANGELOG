### 0.12.x
**0.12.0**

- Fixed potential [issue](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/issues/12495) involving the Keras `Masking` 
layer not functioning as documented. This is not expected to affect any EFN models that
were padded with zeros, nor any PFN models for which the padding was consistent across training and testing
sets. Thanks to Anders Andreassen for pointing this out!
- Added arbitrary attribute lookup in the underlying model for all EnergyFlow architectures.
- Deprecated old EFN/PFN parameter names.
- Built-in support for ModelCheckpoint and EarlyStopping callbacks for neural network models.
- Made naming of neural network layers optional, allowing pieces to be reused more easily.
- Support for periodic phi values in EMD module.
- Added support for passing arbitrary compilation options to Keras models.
- Added EMD Demo notebook


### 0.11.x
**0.11.2**

- Added advanced activations support for neural network architectures. Thanks to Kevin Bauer for this suggestion!

**0.11.1**

- Fixed issue when using Python 2 caused by not importing division in dataset loading code. Thanks to Matt LeBlanc 
for pointing this out!
- Added `n_iter_max` option to EMD functions.

**0.11.0**

- Added `emd` module to EnergyFlow. This new module is not imported by default and relies on
the [Python Optimal Transport](https://pot.readthedocs.io) library and [SciPy](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/).
