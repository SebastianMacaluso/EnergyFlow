    "\n",
    "### Energy Flow Polynomials\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we introduce the EnergyFlow package for computing arbitrary Energy Flow Polynomials (EFPs) and collections of EFPs. The package is built with both usability, flexibility, and computational efficiency in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a collection of $M$ particles with energy measure $z_i$ and pairwise angular distance measures $\\theta_{ij}$, the EFPs are multiparticle energy correlator observables, indexed by multigraphs $G$, and defined as:\n",
    "$$ \\mathrm{EFP}_G = \\sum_{i_1=1}^M \\sum_{i_2=1}^M\\cdots \\sum_{i_N=1}^M z_{i_1}z_{i_2}\\cdots z_{i_N} \\prod_{(k,\\ell)\\in G} \\theta_{i_ki_\\ell},$$\n",
    "where $(k,\\ell)\\in G$ iterates over the edges in the multigraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choices of Measure\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific choice of energy and angular measures depends on the collider context. We provide the following `measure` options (default is `hadrdot`):\n",
    "\n",
    "`hadr`: $$ z_i = p_{T,i}^\\kappa,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, \\theta_{ij} = ((y_i - y_j)^2 + (\\phi_i - \\phi_j)^2)^{\\beta/2} $$\n",
    "`hadrdot`: $$ z_i = p_{T,i}^\\kappa,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, \\theta_{ij} = (2\\, \\hat p_i^\\mu \\hat p_{i\\,\\mu})^{\\beta/2},\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, \\mathrm{where }\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\hat p_i^\\mu \\equiv p_i^\\mu/p_{T,i}  $$\n",
    "`ee`: $$ z_i = E_i^\\kappa,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, \\theta_{ij} = (2\\, \\hat p_i^\\mu \\hat p_{i\\,\\mu})^{\\beta/2},\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, \\mathrm{where }\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\hat p_i^\\mu \\equiv p_i^\\mu/E_i $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The energy and angular weighting parameters `kappa` and `beta` default to $\\kappa=1$ and $\\beta = 2$. The choice of $\\kappa = 1$ is required for infrared and collinear (IRC) safety of the observables. Any choice of $\\beta > 0$ guarantees IRC safety. We also provide the `normed` option (default is `True`) to use a normalized and dimensionless energy measure $z_i/\\sum_{j=1}^M z_j$ rather than $z_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this refresher, we have enough to begin using EnergyFlow to compute arbitrary EFPs! Ensure you have EnergyFlow installed. It is easily `pip` installable by executing:\n",
    "` pip install energyflow `\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by importing the EnergyFlow package as well as some other helpful Python libraries."

    "Let's get some events. Typically these would be read in from your favorite event generator for your physics case of interest.\n",

    "For the purposes of this tutorial, we will uniformly sample massless $M$-body phase space with the use of our implementation of the [RAMBO](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010465586901190?via%3Dihub) algorithm via the function `ef.gen_massless_phase_space`. It returns `nevents` events consisting of `nparticles` massless four-momenta with center of mass energy of `energy` in the center of momentum frame. In general, EnergyFlow supports events as arrays of four-momenta `[E,px,py,pz]` or arrays of hadronic coordinates `[pT,y,phi]` for hadronic measures.\n",
